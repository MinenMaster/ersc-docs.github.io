# FAQ

## Category 1
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Can I get achievements when playing this mod?</summary>

>Yes, you can.  
>List of items that *could* potentially not allow achievements to trigger:
>  - Potential that sometimes Steam will go down during a play session momentarily and prevent achievement unlocks. Missing achievements could be gained with `Steam Achievement Manager` which is a tool used to debug situations like this.
>  - A mismatch in events not triggering the achievement to unlock. This could happen during a play session, where a player's progress can cause skips of certain events to trigger, or an event flag not triggering properly. (Create a manual backup save if you play with another player who could have a different progress).

<summary>How is progress saved for gameplay and items?</summary>


> **GAMEPLAY PROGRESS:**
> - Progress is saved based on Host progression. Wanderer's progression will not sync if Host has progressed less than the Wanderers.
>  - A player on NG+, can join a player on NG. This can also be vice-versa.
> - Any crafting or shop items to purchase from the Twin Maiden Husks in Roundtable Hold are dependent on the **__HOST__** of the world. If a Wanderer owns it in their world, it shouldn't be available in a Host's world if they haven't retrieved it yet when Wanderers join. 
 > - If the Host <u>**does not**</u> own the crafting kit, or cookbook items, then it will <u>**not**</u> be available. Everyone should retrieve these items on their own just in case the Host is changed during gameplay.
> - Quest progression can be erratic. Best to be solo when doing anything, but make sure to make a backup save before playing. Ending choices could have unknown effects during gameplay too.  
>  
> **ITEM PROGRESS:**
> - Item pick ups are based on instanced loot, meaning any random drops picked up are diferent for each player. 
> - Loot that is given on persistent enemy defeat (Bosses and Scarabs for example) is collected by everyone joining the host when within the area limits (when all players ar
e in Weeping Penninsula to get respective drops).
> - Items like Golden Seed or Sacred Tear must be picked up individually. Wanderer's cannot gain items again if they already received them in their world upon joining Host.
> - When it comes to bell bearing items, it is based on Host. Only Host should turn in items, restart session, and any who rejoin should see items in the shop. In the event of missing items for any bell bearings, consult [(Discord) Missing reward items from Quests/NPC/Bosses with dialogue](https://discord.com/channels/979042878091329587/1129602576996900864).
>  
> **‼️CAUTION‼️**  
> If you are going to attempt playing with others who have different progressions (e.g. different endings, different NPC states), **you should make a backup of your save before joining!.**  
> Event flags toggled in the session may persist, so it's very possible to have mismatched progression and may ruin characters involved. See possible work arounds in [(Discord) #troubleshooting](https://discord.com/channels/979042878091329587/1097343990480777266). Keep the same host when possible to reduce chances. This is a coop, not an MMO.

<summary>What happens if the game receives an update? Will the mod break?</summary>

> Refer to [(Discord) Elden Ring received an official update, what to do?](https://discord.com/channels/979042878091329587/1097350937573593160).  
>  
> **Note**:  Major updates like DLC tend to break the mod due to changes done to provide content (changes in regulation.bin file cause seamless to break if something major is adjusted). Hot fixes on the other hand could only be minor changes that won't change much and still allow mods to be compatible, if it's small parameter changes.
