<details markdown="block">
<summary> Failed, nosession found </summary>

>To connect, one player must use the Tiny Great Pot. After that, all other players must use the Effigy of Malenia.
>
>Proceed with the following debugging steps:
>1. Purchase the game on Steam. Piracy is not supported and won't ever be. The mod will not work unless everyone has a unique copy.
>
>2. Make sure everyone playing has the same Elden Ring version. Version can be seen at the title screen, bottom right.
>
>3. Make sure everyone is running the same Seamless Coop version.
>
>4. If anyone uses other mods, you need to double check that the correct launcher is being used. It's possible one person did not launch the correct version of the game to play with others.
><b><u>NOTE:Make</u></b> sure everyone is using the same regulation.bin file mods.
>
><b><u>IMPORTANT NOTE:</u></b> Both of these versions are listed in the start menu. You can share pics to verify you match.
>
>5. Make sure everyone has set the same password in the seamlesscoopsettings.ini. You must save the file and restart the game entirely for the new password to be registered.
>
>6. Everyone must be connected to Steam's Friends network.
>
>7. Verify game files in steam. It should verify rougly 450-600 files else try again.
>
> <b><u>NOTE:</u></b> During Steam maintenance, connectivity will go offline. This usually doesn't last more than a few minutes.
>
>8. Do not block any players  on Steam in your group.
>
>9. If all the above checks out, test out your connection in vanilla Elden Ring. If that works, Seamless Coop has been blocked by your firewall or antivirus.
>
><b>EXTRA: If you trust other people in the session and don't mind them knowing your IP address</b>, you can improve the connection quality by sharing your IP directly.
><b>In Steam, Steam => Settings => In-Game => Steam Networking and set it to "Always".</b>
